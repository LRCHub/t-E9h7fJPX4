Right time to quit
You got me feeling there's not a right time
Right time to quit
You got me feeling there's not a right time
You're sharpening your scalpel
Like sharpening your whit
The world is gonna kill ya
But you're never gonna quit
It's open-heart surgery
There's nothing wrong with it
But your operating table needs a sanitizer hit
You used to cut me oh so deep
I had nothing to say
and all the little pieces you keep
I wish you'd give them away
You're sharpening your scalpel
Like sharpening your whit
The world is gonna kill ya
But you're never gonna quit
It's open-heart surgery
There's nothing wrong with it
But your operating table needs a sanitizer hit
Waking up feeling so numb
I got nothing to say
Check for any piece of myself
You might have taken away
Right time to quit
You got me feeling there's not a right time
Right time to quit
You got me feeling there's not a right time
